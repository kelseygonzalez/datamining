# datamining
A repository for collaboratory data mining work between [Laura Werthmann](https://www.laurawerthmann.com/) and [Kelsey Gonzalez](https://kelseygonzalez.github.io/)  
Data is from [Kaggle: Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)  
Code and r scripts are created for [Dr. Hong Cui's](https://ischool.arizona.edu/people/hong-cui) INFO 523 Course on Data Mining at the University of Arizona
