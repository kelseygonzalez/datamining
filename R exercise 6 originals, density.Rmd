```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r global_options, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.width=5)
```


Load packages
```{r}
library(dbscan)
library(dplyr) # for data cleaning
library(ISLR) # for college dataset
# The package dbscan provides high performance code for DBSCAN and OPTICS
```

use simulated data to show the use of dbscan
```{r}
set.seed(2)
n <- 400

# generate four slightly overlapping Gaussians in 2-D space with 100 points each.

x <- cbind(
   #points (x,y): random normally distributed data adding uniform distribution noices (runif)
   #runif(4, 0, 1) generate 4 uniform distributed data values in [0, 1]
   x = runif(4, 0, 1) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1),
   y = runif(4, 0, 1) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1)
   )
```

cluster labels
```{r}
true_clusters <- rep(1:4, time = 100)
# take a look at the data, 4 colors and symbols to indicate true clusters for the points                     
plot(x, col = true_clusters, pch = true_clusters) #col: color, pch:symbols
```

next, we need to decide on minPts and eps. 
The rule of thumb fo minPts = # of dimensions of the dataset + 1, this is 3 in our case
eps can be determined by plotting the points' kNN distances (ie. the distance to the kth nearest neighbor)
in increasing order and look for a knee in the plot. 
distance of each data point to its 3 nearest neighbor is plotted (3x400 =1200 distances)

```{r}
kNNdistplot(x, k=3)
# distance 0.05 is the "knee", adding a reference line to show this
abline(h=0.05, col ="red", lty=2)
```

now perform DBSCAN
```{r}
res <- dbscan(x, eps=0.05, minPts=3)
# points with cluster id = 0 are noise. 
res
# dbscan alsp provide a plot that adds convect cluster hulls to the scatter plot. 
plot(x, col=res$cluster+1L, pch=res$cluster+1L)
```

```{r}
hullplot(x, res)
```

to see the cluster assignment of the original data points
```{r}
predict(res, x[1:25,], data=x) #the first 25 data points
predict(res, x, data=x) 
```

Clustering with OPTICS
To benefit from the flexibility of OPTICS algorithm, we select larger eps and minPts to run OPTICS
minPts = 10 means the core-distance is defined as the distance to the 9th nearest neighbor
```{r}
res_op <- optics(x, eps=10, minPts = 10)
```
Some additional parameters you will see in the result:
eps_cl: another threshold on eps may be used for identify final clusters, eps_cl<=eps
xi: if use optics or hierarchical clustering, xi is the steepness threshold to identify clusters hierarchically using the reachability plot.
```{r}
res_op
```
to get the computed order of the points
The order says that data point 1 in the data set is the first in the order, data point 363 is the second and so forth
```{r}
head(res_op$order, n= 50)
```
This density-based order produced by OPTICS can be directly used to plot a reachability plot
4 Valleys represent potential clusters separated by peaks. Very high peaks may indicate noise points.
```{r}
plot(res_op)
abline(h=0.065, col ="red", lty=2) #add a reference cutting line (lty=2 draws a dashed line) for extracting the clusters later
```


We can also visualize the order on the original datasets by plotting a ploygon on top of the original data points using the order
if you run a smaller example, combining the order information with the graph,  you will be able see clearly the order of the visit of the points in the dataset.
```{r}
plot(x, col="red")
polygon(x[res_op$order,])
```

Now we can extract a DBSCAN-type clustering based on the reachability plot
Because this method extracts clusters like DBSCAN,it cannot identify partitions that exhibit very significant differences in density
As shown above, eps_cl=0.065 will result in 4 clusters
```{r}
res_op_c <- extractDBSCAN(res_op, eps_cl=0.065)
plot(res_op_c)

hullplot(x, res_op_c)

res_op_c #we can see 92 points were not included in the clusters
```
this can be a reliable way to identify tight clusters in a dataset and tight clusters can be used a summary of the daaset.


We can also extract a hierarchical cluster structure using extract Xi
xi is the steepness threshold, describes the relative magnitude of the change of cluster density (i.e., reachability) 
Significant changes in relative reachability allow for clusters to manifest themselves hierarchically as ‘dents’ in the ordering structure. The hierarchical representation ExtractXi can, as opposed to the ExtractDBSCAN method, produce clusters of varying densities.
Clusters are represented as contiguous ranges in the reachability plot and are available in the field clusters_xi

```{r}
(res_op_h <- extractXi(res_op, xi=0.05))
res_op_h$clusters_xi
```

We can visualize the clusters in the reachability plot
clusters represented using colors and vertical bars below the plot.
```{r}
plot(res_op_h)
hullplot(x, res_op_h)
```

To represent the hierarchical clustering as a dendrogram
```{r}
(dend <- as.dendrogram(res_op_h))
plot(dend, ylab="Reachability distance", leaflab="none")
```

Run OPTICS on the College dataset, using gower_dist matrix
```{r}

set.seed(1680) # for reproducibility
data(College, package="ISLR")
college_clean <- College %>%
   mutate(name = row.names(.),
          accept_rate = Accept/Apps,
          isElite = cut(Top10perc,
                        breaks = c(0, 50, 100),
                        labels = c("Not Elite", "Elite"),
                        include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
   mutate(isElite = factor(isElite)) %>%
   select(name, accept_rate, Outstate, Enroll,
          Grad.Rate, Private, isElite)

gower_dist <- daisy(college_clean[, -1],
                     metric = "gower",
                     type = list(logratio = 3))

dim(college_clean)
# 7 dimensions, so set k = 8
kNNdistplot(gower_dist, k=8)
abline(h=0.05, col='red', lty=2)

(res_col <- optics(gower_dist, eps=10, minPts = 10))
plot(res_col)
```


```{r}
# 3 clusters, 78 noise points
(res_col_d <- extractDBSCAN(res_col, eps_cl=0.05))
# 4 clusters, 2 noise points
(res_col_h <- extractXi(res_col, xi=0.05))
res_col_h$clusters_xi #cluster 4 is tiny, what is in there?
plot(res_col_h)

dend_col <-as.dendrogram(res_col_h)
plot(dend_col)
```
12 Universities in cluster 4, almost exactly match the smallest cluster produced by PAM (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor not in the current list)
```{r}

college_clean[res_col_h$order[765:776],]
```

```{r}
# which cluster is UMich at Ann Arbor?
college_clean[college_clean$name=="University of Michigan at Ann Arbor", ]
match(638, res_col_h$order)
```
Michigan is 777 in the order, by checking res_col_h$clusters_xi, it is one of the two outliers
by comparing the results from OPTICS with PAM and see they are similar, our confidence in the clusters identified increases.
